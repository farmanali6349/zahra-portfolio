# Text Animation

## Tools Utilized:
I utilized HTML, CSS and JS.I used Visual Studio as a text editor.

## Description:
This is a very simple hero section design that contains a simple hover effect at menu items and button arrow move effect and more special one the animated text background effect.

## Process:
I picked up two colors for the design. White and a yellowish one from it's logo.
Then I created a background animation of an image behind the text of main heading at the hero image by changing the background position. The animation code is as follows

```
animation: back 20s farward infinite;
background-position: 0 0;
@keyframe back {
	background-position: 1200px 0;
	}
```
